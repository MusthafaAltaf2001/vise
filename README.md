# Common github work practices

- Create branches on github under your own name.
- Commit and push frequently into your own branch only. Do not commit to release or pre-release directly from your local machine.
- Merge from your branch to pre-release branch only after completion of a certain feature.
- Merge from pre-release to release only after receiving confirmation from PM that the feature works as expected.
- After pushing to release, ensure that pre-release branch and individual branches are uptodate with the release branch.
